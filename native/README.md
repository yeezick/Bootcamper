# Getting set up with React Native

The following must be installed and configured before starting React Native

### Expo

Install `Expo CLI` by running:

```
$ npm install --global expo-cli
```

### XCode

Download v13.2.1 from the [Apple Website here](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Once XCode is installed

- Open XCode
- Open Preferences
- Select the `Locations` tab
- Select the latest version in the following dropdown. If this is your first time installing XCode, it will be empty & only have 1 option.

### Java

It's possible you may also have to install Java for the Android parts to work correctly, like the Android simulator for ecample. If you run into errors during installation, make sure to let me know.

I already had Java downloaded on my machine, but this would be important to resolve.

### Dependencies

By this point it should be safe to install the dependencies for the app with: `npm install`
